## The Power of Memory

Martian culture has long believed that **memories** make us who we are. Indeed Martians often lament the forgetfulness of the Earthlings. If Earthligns remembered history, they would not repeat it.

When making your **muckraker** draw three **tarot cards** (players new to tarot may wish to just use the major arcana, which have more clear interpretations).

Each tarot card represents a past memory of your character. Consult the chart below and build a memory based on what you draw. You can **tap** (turn sideways) one of your memories to get a suspicious NPC to give you more information (see [interviews](intro.md)) if your memory has a **sympathy** related to that NPC.  This represents that your life experience has given you insight into certain kinds of people.

**Card** | **Meanings** | **Recommended Memory** | **Sympathies**

0 **The Fool** | Foolishness, new beginnings | You once made a serious mistake. What happened? How did it impact you? | Those struggling with guilt.

## Skills

A muckraker needs to be talented to find the truth.  Areas of expertise fall into **Mind**, **Body** and **Spirit**. If the skill has a *!* a genetic die and a harm is always required for those rolls.  This is because those skills require inherently draining uses of your alien ancestry.  Rolls without a *!* can be done without a genetics die, but if your *blessing* (see below) may be a benefit, you can choose to add it anyway, for the benefits described in [prime mechanic](PrimeMechanic.md).

When using body skills you must use a genetics die if you are doing something that would require **superhuman strength**.

You have 20 skill points to assign to your skills.  Only one skill can be +4 and only two skills can be +3, all others must be +2 or less.  You must have at least one skill in each category

If you have a **genetic malfunction** (see [prime mechanic](PrimeMechanic.md)) when using a *!* skill or when envoking **superhuman strength** and you were not explicitly using your a genetic **blessing** (see below) the GM can decide which of your **curses** activate.

**Mind** | **Body** | **Spirit**
--- | --- | --- | ---
ü§î **Focus** used to notice details in a time of chaos and maintain concentration |üò≤ **Reflex** Used to stay on your feet and dodge  | ü§ù **Diplomatics** Used to make deals and convince people
üå≤ **Nature** used to understand and interact with plants and animals |üí™ **Muscle** Used for general feats of strength  |üò™ **Hypnostic Suggestion** *!* Used to make someone follw simple, but non-dangerous instructions.  Can't be used to make someone reveal crimes.
üß™ **Science** used to understand and interact with scientific equipment | ü§ª **Parkour** Used to scale walls and do gymnastics to reach hard-to-enter places  |üß† **Mindread** *!* Used to hear the thoughts of another. If you fail, they are aware that someone made an attempt to read their mind, though they don't automatically know who.
ü§ñ **Robotics** used to understand and interact with androids, computers and machines |ü§´ **Stealth** Used to remain hidden  |üëÅÔ∏è **Attune** *!* Used to hear the last thoughts of someone who held an object.
üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄ **Forensics** used to interpet evidence at crime scenes |üèÉ **Athletics** Used to impress and win contests  |üëæ **Read** *!* Used to detect the alien powers of another.

## Energy

You have three **energy pools** associted with the **Mind**, the **Body** and the **Spirit**.  Each pool is equal to 3 + the number of skill points you have in the pool's associated skills.  

## The Blessing and the Curse

As you are half human and half martian, your genetic powers can **malfunction**.  Some actions are only possible if you use your **blessing** (e.g. if you need to remain underwater for a long period of time you will need to envoke a **aquatica** blessing, unless you have special equipment).  Sometimes a GM will rule that envoking a blessing can be used to remove all associated **hazard dice** with a muckraker roll, if the superpower would help the character perform an action safely.  For an actons that are strictly speaking possible for humans but are easier to do with **super strength** or a character's blessing, a +3 is added to their roll, if the player is willing to risk having a genetics die in their dice roll.  

Which brings us to the downside of your unstable powers.  If you do not roll a 7 or a double, and the genetic die is the highest die, the **Curse** of your genetics is activated.  This manifests as a set of situations where your character will take more harm until you either **Roll another 7** or the condition causes you to add a sufficient amount of **hazard dice** as determined by the chart below. What this means in game terms, is that the GM will add more hazard dice to some of your rolls, using the **instability chart** and the narrative nature of your curse as guidence.  These hazard rolls may not occur immedately, but will occur when the GM deems it probable that your genetic curse would cause your character problems.  The narrative description of the **curse** should also inform your roleplay. 

The number of hazard dice the GM can add to your rolls depends on your **instability** which increases after each genetic malfunction. 

A **muckraker** generally has two such pairs of traits due to their alien ancestry.  More in [Muck Rolls](PrimeMechanic.md).

Name | Blessing | Curse
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Maddening Memory** | You can remember details with astonishing clarity, even if you only briefly saw the information.  You can recall most events in your life.  | If malfunctioned bad memories of your past startle you. You take an additional hazard dice on your next focus or spirit roll
**Aquatica**  | Used to not need oxygen or breath for a long period of time. Inhaled toxins and drowning do not cause you to roll harm dice  | If malfunctioned you have difficulty breathing outside of water. You take additional hazard die on body roll
**Animalkin** | When using the nature skill you can give complex instructions to animals  | If malfunctioned you are mute to humans. This can cause extra hazards due to your failure to communicate
**Mimic** | When you use a skill to mimic another person you can shapeship and replicate their appearence  | If malfunctioned your limbs come to be slightly different sizes which can add hazards to body rolls.
**Healing Touch** | You can use the science skill to heal others by drawing on healing energies in your body. On a successful roll you can heal 1d6, up to three times a day  | If malfunctioned you start absorbing negative energy all round you.  If you cooperate with a teammate to do an action, you must take one of their damage dies on yourself. Until this curse is cleared it is physically painful for you to be around people who are even slightly ill.
**Chained to the Rhythm** | You can make a muckraker roll to play music. On a success all people you designate are completely focused on your song due to your understanding of higher sonic frequencies  | If malfunctioned music starts playing in your head which causes hazards when doing any mental skill
**Sonic Screech** | You can use a nature or robotics roll to mimic any natural or manmade phenonomon as you see fit.  You can "throw" this noise to originate from any point you see  | If malfunctioned you deafen an ally.  This causes *them* to have an extra hazard dice on any skill that requires use of the ears.
**Echo Location** | When using a skill that normally requires the use of sight, you can do it blind and even hear most sounds through most walls  | If malfunctioned any loud noise can cause you to take extra hazard die.
**Arachnid Touch** | You can scale sheer surfaces like a spider  | If malfunctioned you can take harm due to things randomly sticking to your hands.
**Fearful Stare** | You can determine, in cryptic terms, what someone's worst fear is my staring into their eyes  | If malfunctioned you can take harm due hallucinating the worst nightmares of the people around you
**Peaceful Stare** | You can determine, in cryptic terms, what makes someone feel at peace.  | If malfunctioned you are easily distracted by the day dreams of people around you which can cause harm.
**Speedster** | You can for brief periods of time (< 5 seconds) move faster than the speed of sound | If malfunctioned on body rolls your body may suddenly want to speed up which may cause extra harm
**Gravity Wings** | You can fly | If malfunctioned you cannot land and any skill roll that needs to be done with you close to the ground can be hazardous
**Energy Eyes** | You can superheat items by staring at them | If malfunctioned your eyes start firing energy seemingly at random which can cause you to suddenly need to shut your eyes to prevent catastrophy
**Technomancy** | You can place your mind inside of computers and machinery to control them | If malfunctioned machines around you can suddenly start behaving oddly, which can cause electrical injuries and other calamities

Furthermore, remember that all roleplay must be done with the assumption that the condition your character is experiencing is active - some things will be harder for your character to do until the genetic imbalance passes.

## Level of Genetic Malfunction

All players start at a malfunction level of 1. Each time a genetic malfunction manifests the amount of hazard die the Game Master can add to your rolls at narratively approprate times increases.  These hazard die are added to rolls where the malfunction may cuase the character to expend more energy, have mishaps or otherwise take more harm.  The GM can choose to have them all occur at once, or over several rolls as is narratively appropriate.  

**Instability Level** | Number of Hazard Die| Notes
--- | --- | ---
**Level 1** | Stable | 1 d2 (either use a coin or evens on a d6 are worth 2 harm & odds are worth 1 harm)
**Level 2**  | Relatively stable  | 1d6
**Level 3**  | Destablizing  | 2d6 (either on one roll or one each on two rolls)
**Level 4**  | Destablized  | 3d6 (either on one roll or one each on three rolls)
**Level 5**  | Genomic sickness  | 4d6 (either on one roll or one each on three rolls)
**Level 6**  | Mutating  | At this point the character becomes ill and has evident alien ancestry due to mutations and must rest for at least an hour

A character's genetic embalance level resets with 4 hours rest or decreases by one when finding **key evidence**, due to the morale boost of finding key evidence.
