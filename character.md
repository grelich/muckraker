## The Power of Memory

Martian culture has long believed that **memories** make us who we are. Indeed Martians often lament the forgetfulness of the Earthlings. If Earthligns remembered history, they would not repeat it.

When making your **muckraker** draw three **tarot cards** (players new to tarot may wish to just use the major arcana, which have more clear interpretations).

Each tarot card represents a past memory of your character. Consult the chart below and build a memory based on what you draw. You can **tap** (turn sideways) one of your memories to get a suspicious NPC to give you more information (see [interviews](interviews.md)) if your memory has a **sympathy** related to that NPC.  Your life experience has given you insight into certain kinds of people.

**Card** | **Meanings** | **Recommended Memory** | **Sympathies**
--- | --- | --- | ---
0 **The Fool** | Foolishness, new beginnings | You once made a serious mistake. What happened? How did it impact you? | Those struggling with guilt.
1 **The Magician** | Willpower, confidence | No one believed your abilities until you ____ through sheer force of will | Underdogs and those who have no one to believe in them.
2 **The High Priestess** | Secrets | Something happened that you have never told anyone. What is it? |Those who doubt authority.
3 **The Empress** | Motherhood | A mother figure in your life did something that impacted you to this day. What is it? | Those seeking to provide to their children.

7 **The Chariot** | Triumph | You overcame a great adversary. Who was it? | Those preparing for a battle, whether literal or metaphorical.
8 **Strength** | Courage | You faced your greatest fear and came out the other side. What happened? | Those who are scared.
9 **The Hermit** | Treason | Someone betrayed you. What happened? | Those who lack trust due to past wounds.
10 **Wheel of Fortune** | Destiny | You had a sudden and shocking change of fate. What happened? | Those who have suddenly had a reversal of fortune, whether good or bad.

## Stability

You have two numbers that help illuminate your characters inner conflict.  One is your **Stress number** which starts at 2. The other is your **genetics number** which starts between 4 and 8.  The higher the number, the stronger your character embraces their genetic heritage . . . and greater the likelihood they are forgetting human social norms.  [Learn more](stability.md)

## Skills

A muckraker needs to be talented to find the truth.  Areas of expertise fall into **Mind**, **Body** and **Spirit**. If the skill has a *!* a genetic die and a harm is always required for those rolls.  This is because those skills require inherently draining uses of your alien ancestry.  Rolls without a *!* can be done without a genetics die, but if your *blessing* (see below) may be a benefit, you can choose to add it anyway.

You have 20 skill points to assign to your skills.  Only one skill can be +4 and only two skills can be +3, all others must be +2 or less.  You must have at least one skill in each category


**Mind** | **Body** | **Spirit**
--- | --- | --- | ---
🤔 **Focus** used to notice details in a time of chaos and maintain concentration |😲 **Reflex** Used to stay on your feet and dodge  | 🤝 **Diplomatics** Used to make deals and convince people
🌲 **Nature** used to understand and interact with plants and animals |💪 **Muscle** Used for general feats of strength  |😪 **Hypnostic Suggestion** *!* Used to make someone follw simple, but non-dangerous instructions.  Can't be used to make someone reveal crimes.
🧪 **Science** used to understand and interact with scientific equipment | 🤻 **Parkour** Used to scale walls and do gymnastics to reach hard-to-enter places  |🧠 **Mindread** *!* Used to hear the thoughts of another. If you fail, they are aware that someone made an attempt to read their mind, though they don't automatically know who.
🤖 **Robotics** used to understand and interact with androids, computers and machines |🤫 **Stealth** Used to remain hidden  |👁️ **Attune** *!* Used to hear the last thoughts of someone who held an object.
🕵️‍♀ **Forensics** used to interpet evidence at crime scenes |🏃 **Athletics** Used to impress and win contests  |👾 **Read** *!* Used to detect the alien powers of another.

## Energy

You have three **energy pools** associted with the **Mind**, the **Body** and the **Spirit**.  Each pool is equal to 3 + the number of skill points you have in the pool's associated skills.  

## Using Memory

Memories can impact the game in three ways.  They can be tapped, as described above, to trigger insight into a conversation with an NPC who qualifies as one your **Sympathies**.  When this is done the GM roleplays that the NPC opens up to you and shares a little bit more information than they would otherwise or that even if they are trying to conceal information, you can pick up a few extra details others have missed based on what they were willing to say.

If you are doing a difficult **muck roll** and you would like an extra boost, you can tap a memory that you believe would give your character extra **insight** into that situation to get a +3 to the roll.  Furthermore such a roll is protected from triggering an increase in the **hazard level**.

Each time you tap a memory you reduce your **genetic number** by 1 because accessing your memories helps ground you in your humanity.  

If a **plot twist** occurs and the triggering card is a **major arcana** that was the basis of one of your memories, that plot twist impacts you more than the other players.  Your past life has coniditoned you to be more sensitive to the issues represented by that tarot card.  The memory is **tapped** (if it is untapped) without any benefit to you and your **stress number** increases by 1.  If the card is already **tapped** it is **turned over** and your **stess number** increases by 2.
