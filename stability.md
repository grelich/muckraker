Your character is a **half-breed**, part human, part alien.  You are torn between two worlds and this wares on you, emotionally and even genetically as your genetic code is unsure if it will mutate over to your inner martian or stabilize into your humanity.  

You have two numbers that help illuminate your characters inner conflict.  One is your **Stress number** which starts at 2. The other is your **genetics number** which starts between 4 and 8.  The higher the number, the stronger your character embraces their genetic heritage . . . and greater the likelihood they are forgetting human social norms.  

Different **plot twists** will cause these numbers to change.  If your **stress number** equals or exceeds your **genetic number** you cannot envoke your alien heritage as described in [dice](dice.md).  If your **genetic number** reaches twelve, you get **mutation sickness** and are removed from the scene until your character can recover (usually a nights rest and paying a healer.)

Your stability will also impact your character's **interviews** (learn more [here](interviews.md)).
