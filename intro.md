## Game Start

This is a storytelling game told between players, who play muckrakers with otherworldly ancestry, and a gamemaster, who designs a mystery.

You, the player, are a *half-breed*, a human who still has some ancestry from the aliens who used to live among us. Now Earth has turned its back on the stars.  Most deny that aliens exist because that is what **THEY** (the nexus of corrupt conspiracies that run the world) want you to think.  There are still those who hunt your kind so you must use your powers in secret.

There is a resistance paper being circulated among the Earthlings, one that calls for Earth to open its mind to the possibility of other Worlds.  It is run by **Sarah Debattista** who tries to convince people that aliens are real . . . and that they can be our friends.

Earthling governments grow more corrupt each day so you serve as a mild-mannered reporter for this resistence paper (which most say is just gonzo journalism).  You seek to uncover the truth, hoping one day the truth about you can be shared openly.

At the opening of the game, the game master, playing Sarah, will explain what incident or lead you are being sent out to research for the **Martian Muckraker.**

You and the other players will devise a **cover story** that will allow you to investigate.  

As the story unfolds, you narrate to the GM what your character does.  The GM will narrate what the non-player characters (leads, suspects and potentialy evil conspirators) do.  Sometimes we will throw dice to see what happens.

## Muck Rolls

Going undercover is dangerous.  To keep cover, you may be pretending to help build secret government laboratories that have dangerous equipment.  You may be investigating strange animals that Earthlings keep taking blurred pictures of. . . and wind up having to dodge claws and teeth. But the greatest threat is just being exposed.  As a muckraker you are somewhere where you are **not supposed to be.**  And that risks blowing your cover.

When an action risks blowing your cover (which will frankly be most, given how nosey muckrakers are) you will need to do a [muck roll](PrimeMechanic.md).

## Evidence

To win, you will need to find at least three pieces of **key evidence**.  Each time key evidence is found you are one step closer to having the story of the century, and exposing the truth.  Furthermore, the morale boost of a good lead allows you to heal one d6 of **harm** to your **Mind**, **Body** or **Spirit**. The [muck roll page](PrimeMechanic.md) can explain more on harm.

## Interviews

Often key evidence has to be revealed by winning an Earthling's trust and letting them agree to answer your questions. The game master will have prepared some Non-Player Characters for you to meet as you try and keep your cover.  You must decide how much you will tell who and when, knowing that not everyone is apt to be kind to you. You have found that drawing on your life story can give you insight and can help you build common ground with others.  When you [make a character](character.md) you will draw three **Tarot cards** that each represent a memory and each imply a certain group of people you can most easily make connections with (referred to as your **Sympathies**).  

If you turn one of your memory cards sideways (**Tapping it**) you can convince you can convince an earthling whom you are speaking with and who qualififies as one of your sympathies to share a bit more information with you.  A tapped memory can't be used again for this purpose unless it has been untapped by spending XP.  Memories also are untapped between game sessions.

## Righteous Anger

As a reporter you have seen more than your fair share of injustice.  You will pick a **cherished value** that you can't stand to see violated.  If you **alientated** a potential witness by expressing your righteous anger or by refusing to believe what they say (even if it might actually be true) , this is a **mistake** (see below).  Muckrakers want to be unbiased, but no one trully is.  This system is meant to encourage roleplay where one's biases sometimes impact their ability to work with others to find the truth.

## Otherworldly Power

You also have alien powers you can draw on to help with your investigation. But powers can come with genetic imbalances.  You are only part martian and your genetic code is still mutating.  You will learn more about this when you [make a character](charcter.md).

## Mistakes

Muckrakers learn from their mistakes.  Each time you either raise the **hazard level**, take **2d6 harm in one roll**, or **act out of your anger** you gain an XP point (which can be represented by coins, tokens, or just checkmarks on paper).  

You can spend XP points as follows:

1. 2 xp points - untap a memory card.
2. 5 xp points - Memory refresh and reveal - untap all memory and draw a new tarot card to add a new memory to your character.
3. 5 xp points - gain three skill points to add to your character.
