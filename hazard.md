The characters are somewhere where they are not supposed to be.  To be there they need to **keep their cover story** or remain **Undetected**. There are six hazard levels that describe how well hidden the character's true intentions are.  Each time a **doubles** leads to a **court card** being drawn the characters slip up and do something that causes their cover to have cracks.  

1. Safe
2. Relatively Safe
3. Intial Doubts
4. Rising Concern
5. Suspicion
6. Walking on Eggshells

The hazard level represents how stable the character's cover story is.  If a **court card** is drawn when the characters are walking on eggshells, their **cover** is blown, and the players loose out on this mission.
