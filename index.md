Nellie Bly was one of the greatest Earthling Muckrakers, most famous for going undercover to expose an insane asylum.

The Muckraker System is an RPG system about Muckrakers 🕵️ - reporters, private eyes, detectives and spies who have to find **evidence** but must do so without blowing their cover. To find the truth of the corruption they are trying to expose they are willing to risk their lives, their honor and possibly even exposing their secret . . . *that these muckrakers have superpowers.*  

These are the Chronicles of the 👽 **Martian Muckraker** 👽 The Last Honest Newspaper in the Milkyway!  

## Why Play Martian Muckraker

1. High narrative and rules light
2. Use of Tarot cards for plot twists and character creation
3. Bloodless - in the Muckraker system combat is not an option, you are here for **truth**, not bloodshed
4. Emphasis on Character driven storytelling
