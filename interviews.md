Upon meeting a new NPC you do an **impression roll**.  You roll a twelve sided die.  If you role above your **genetics number** your more human side is able to shine through and the NPC has a **positive** impression of you.  If you roll below your **genetics number** but above your **stress number** the NPC senses there is something unusual about you and they will be **gaurded**.  If you roll below your **stress number** and your **stress number** is 4 or less they have a **neutral** opinion of you.  If your **stress number** is 4 or more, then they are **gaurded** towards you.  

The Game Master will change how he roll plays the NPC based on how your impression rolls turn out.  Having a high genetics number may allow you to activate your powers, but it makes your otherworldlyness more apparent to Earthlings.  

Most **key evidence** will require gathering **Testimony** from people that you meet during your investigation.  A discussion with an NPC is considered a **full interview** if it involves tapping one of your memories to envoke your insight with the character as one of your **sympathies** (as described in [chracter](character.md).)

An **full interview** interview has 4 parts.

1. **Memory Tap** most people are afraid of the conspiracies that run the world, once they are willing to admit they exist.  As such you will only be able to convince someone to open up to you for a full **interview** that can give **key evidence** by learning enough about them to realize they qualify as one of your **sympathies** and tapping that memory.

2. **Interview Rolls** An interview roll is a special type of **impression roll**.  Anyone who is present who did not do a **memory tap** makes an impression roll, even if they have made one for this NPC already.  If the NPC has a **positive** view of the character they can roll twice and take the more favorable result.  

3. **Calculate Interview Effectiveness** Each memory tap, and each **Positive** impression roll (from the impression roll) is worth one point.  The number of points is the number of **questions** they can ask before the NPC tries to extricate themselves from all these prying questions. If you ask the right question in a **full interview** you can unlock **key evidence**.
