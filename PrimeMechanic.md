In the *Muckraker System* RPG the players play undercover reporters who secretly have alien ancestry. They are trying to find **evidence** without blowing their **cover**.

If an action is either **dangerous** or risks **blowing their cover story** the player who's character is doing that action must do a **Muck Roll**

Two white six-sided dice are rolled.  If there is a possibility of **harm** or **exhaustion** then the GM may add one to three red **harm dice**, based on the level of risk inherent in the action.  The player and the GM agree on which skill on the **character sheet** most clearly relates to the action and a **challenge number** is set.  If the player envokes their **alien biology** to make an action possible a colored **genetics die** is rolled as well.

Results are as follows:

1. **Lucky 7** The white dice show a lucky 7.  The muckraker succeeds, and takes no damage if harm dice were rolled.  The GM also narrates how they find **extra information** or uncover an **added benefit**

2. **Hazard Doubles** When the white dice show doubles, either a hazard escalation or a plot twist can occur.  If the player rolls one of the doubles that is marked as a **hazard double**, given the games current **hazard level**, (see chart below) then the muckraker's action winds up risking their cover or their act is seen by prying eyes ðŸ‘€.  It is paramout that the Earthlings not discover their alien ancestry or that the conspirators discover that they are trying to expose them.  The GM will narrate how someone almost detects them, or starts to get suspicious of their cover story.  The players may need to hide from someone searching for them, or quickly explain what they were doing.  If the hazard doubles are rolled in at a **high risk** situation, the muckrakers have their cover blown and have to abandon the mission. *Example C'therax's player tries to use parkour to slip into a restricted area. A hazard double is rolled. The GM says that they fall spectacularly . . . and then they hear the sound of guards coming.  The Muckrakers need to flee!*

3. **Plot Doubles** If the doubles in question is not a hazard double, instead the GM draws a **tarot card** and uses it to inspire a **plot twist**.  Plot twists interrupt the character's intended action, but can possibly be helpful or lead to new information.  *Example: While trying to sneak into the restricted section of a laboratory, doubles are rolled and the GM pulls "The Tower" from the Tarot Deck, which is associated with calamity.  He narrates that as they go in smoke starts pouring out of the lab . . . whatever exerpiment was happening has caught fire . . .*

4. **Genetic Imbalance** Being only part alien means that your alien powers are unstable.  If the colored genetic die is highest of the dice rolled, the alien power's **curse** activates instead of your intended alien power's **blessing**. **Lucky 7 and doubles take precedence over Genetic Imbalance dice, and furthermore highest, means higher and not equal to any of the white dice, if a white die equals the genetic die, the genetic die is discarded.** The intended action fails.  More about alien powers can be found in [character creation](character.md).

5. **Anything Else** If none of the above rules can be envoked, the white dice are added together, the skill points of the related skill are added to that result and it is compared to the **challenge number**.  If the player equals the challenge number or higher, they succeed.  If they rolled lower they fail.  If the characters genetic heritage provides a **blessing** that can help, and the player risked having a genetic die in their dice pool, they get an additional +3 to their roll.  

6. **Harm Dice**  The hightest of the harm dice (if any), is used to see how much harm the character recieves as a result of their action. The **harm** received is the highest harm dice minus the skill points the character has in the associated skill. More on harm below.  Harm is calculated even if the player succeeds - success can still be dangerous.  Hazard dice are ignored on **doubles** and **Lucky 7s**.  

## Hazard Doubles

The **Hazard Level** denotes how likely the characters are to blow their cover.  The associated **hazard doubles** cause attempted actions to fail when rolled, and furthermore cause the NPCs to start doubting the player's cover stories.  

**Hazard Level** | **Hazard Doubles** | **Notes**
--- | --- | ---
Safe | 1s, 2s | For an easier game or to reward a creative cover story start the hazard level here.
Standard | 1s, 2s, 3s | Most missions start at this hazard level.
Elevated | 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s | Some NPCs doubt . . . but most are still convinced by the cover story.
High | 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s | At this level many NPCs will start being more open about their distrust of the NPCs.
Critical | 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s 6s | If doubles are rolled here, then the players' cover is blown.  All characters lose on this mission.

## Harm

Being undercover is draining.  Your character has dwindling **energy levels** associated with the **mind**, the **body** and the **spirit**.  Harm to the body represents exhaustion and injury.  Just because the muckarkers aren't (or shouldn't) be getting into fights doesn't change that sometimes secretive **Resitricted Areas** have dangerous experiments, traps or other hazards around.  Harm to the find represents mental fatigue.  The spirit represents the inner energy of the person which is used to make connections and . . .  and harness your alien ancestry.  It is harder for the spirit to be externally harmed than mind or body, but some technological systems, especially those that use illusions and fear, can detect the energy within half-breeds and target it.  Certain spirit skills require the presence of a hazard die.  

If you are out of energy in a category you become **vulnerable.**  You cannot use skills in the area (mind body or spirit) that you lack energy in and should you drain another area of energy or roll a hazard double your character is narratively removed from the game, at least until they can recover.
