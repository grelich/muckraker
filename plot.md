When a plot twist occurs a tarot card is drawn and used to determine the nature of the plot twist.

1. **Court Card** The characters fail, and not only do they fail but they give away their position (if they are somewhere they are not supposed to be) or otherwise weakens their covers story.  This causes the game's **hazard level** to increase, and if the hazard level reaches 7 (see [hazard](hazard.md)), all all layers loose as people cease to believe their cover story.  

    - Furthermore each players **stress number** increases by one and their **genetic number** increases by one.

    - Players will need to come up with an excuse for what they are doing, hide from persuers or otherwise due damage control on their cover story.

2. **Major Arcana** The GM either narrates a plot twist, using the imagry of the card as inspiration or safes the card to be played at a later time.

    - Certain characters take the emotional impact of certain plot twist more heavily.  Any player that has a memory that was inspired by the same card has that memory tapped, if it is untapped and has their **stress number** increase by one.  If the memory is already tapped, it is turned **upside down** and their stress number increases by 2.

3. **Minor Arcana**
    - **Swords** (Conflict) The GM narrates a plot twist that either turns a character against the players or that causes a character (usually the character that triggered the plot twist) to take d6 damage to one of their energy levels.  The character that triggered the plot twist has their **Stress number** increase by one.

    - **Cups** (Healing waters) The plot twist actually helps the players.  They meat a new ally, someone decides to be more friendly towards them or they generically succeed at the intended action.  The player that rolled the **plot twist** has their **stress number** decrease by one.

    - **Wands** (Transformation) The player fails at their actopm, and the frustration from this causes their genetic nature to manifest.  The player that rolled the plot twist has their **genetic** number increase by one.  If their **stress** number of 4 or below it *decreases* by one.

    - **Pentacles**  The player fails at their action but they learn something from the experience.  As a result they gain an XP point.  (see [XP Points](xpPoints.md))
