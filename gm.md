Being the game master may seem daunting . . . but dive right in.  All it takes is some imagination.  Here is how to get started

## Lead

You will need to provide the opening lead.  What does **Sarah Debattista**, the editor-in-chief, hope her Muckraker's will find if they research it?  And what is the cover story?

**Example leads and cover stories:**

1. You claim you are reporting on a lab's great economic success, but in reality you what to know why people keep vanishing near by.
2. Power Outages keep occuring in a city at midnight around 2:00.  The local power company says it doesn't know why.  You claim to be doing general reporting on the effect of this on the local residents but in reality you think the power is being siphened off for a secret project.
3. You get a hastily written letter from someone who claims to be the an engineer for a major tech comapny.  He claims alien tech is being gathered for sinister purpose.  You claim to be interns to infiltrate the company.
4. Fourty people have claimed to see bigfoot in an area within the course of one week.  You claim to be a skeptic, but in reality you think it is a stranded alien in need of help.  You believe other people want to find the creature first.  The area swarms with bigfoot enthusists.  
5. A theme park claims to have an alien hostage - is it just a money making fake or does one of your breatheren need help?  You claim to be a roller coaster enthusist but in reality you want to set him free.
6. A disgraced scientist has suddenly been put in chare of a multi-million dollar telescope project in the middle of a national park. Why?  You protect to be science enthusicists near the telescope site as you try to find the device's real purpose. Plenty of campers who claim they've seen strange things are in the area.

## Civilians and Conspirators

Invariably your muckrakers will need to explore some area or organization under a **cover story**.  Along the way they will meet people.  But are they civilians or conspirators?  You will need to invent at least 7-9 people that the players can meet.  This is easier if you invent them in groups.  Perhaps a lead scientist and her two grad student interns, two police officers (partners), and four members of a city council. Are the people in these groups on good terms with each other, or are they having a disagreement?  Do some know more than others in the group?  

Decide who is behind the plot and imagine five sources of key evidence that can reveal their plot.  The players only need to find three - having five allows for the players to solve the case in more than one way.  If a player does something creative that would provide info you can create decide that their action produced key evidence even if it was not what you planned.

For each non-player character imagine a few key events in their life - what **sympathies** can and cannot be evoked to make them share more info?  You don't have to imagine every permutation but having some sense of who these people are will make it easier for you to improv when the time comes.

This is a rules-light high improv game - embrace it.  Follow the "rule of cool" above all.  

## The Conspiracy

You should know the "answer" to the mystery.  Namely:

1. Why is the weird thing happening?
2. Who is responsible for it?
3. What unintended consequences does this conspiracy have?  *Example, creatures escaping, strange lights, people mutating or vanishing, semi-intelligent robots playing pranks etc. etc.*

## Plot Twists

Point three above will be important for plot twists.  The players will roll doubles which will trigger plot twists.  You should imagine beforehand what sorts of plot twists can result from the conspiracy.  The plot twists in the Muckraker System are inspired by drawing Tarot cards.  If you need some inspiration, you may consult the table below.  At the GMs option plot twists don't have to occur immediately, but can be held onto and used at an opportune moment. This can be helpful if none of the recommended plot twists match the current situation. If this is done wether or not the characters **muck roll** succeeds or fails should be decided by the **anything else** rules, as the plot twist is not interrupting their action right away.  (see [Muck Rolls](PrimeMechanic.md))  Furthermore, **Swords** and **Wands** plot twists are allowed to be generically negative, if the situation does not match the symbolism of the card and **Cups** and **pentacles** are generally positive, if the situation does not match the situation of the card.

Plot twists require in-the-monent creativity and improv.  The rules are purposely vague - this is meant to inspire creativity, not serve as a perfect manuel for what to do.
