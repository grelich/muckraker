In the *Muckraker System* RPG the players play undercover reporters who secretly have alien ancestry. They are trying to find **evidence** without blowing their **cover**.

If an action is dangerous, could cause you to be detected when you are somewhere you are not supposed to be, or could otherwise cause your cover to be blown two white six-sided dice are rolled.  The Game Master will set a **challenge number**.  This is called a Muck Roll.

## Muck Rolls

1. **Lucky 7** If the white dice show a seven before any modifiers than the character succeeds and the GM narrates an **added benefit**.

2. **Plot Twist Doubles**  If Doubles are rolled, then the character's action is interrupted by a [plot twist](plot.md).  A tarot card is drawn and is used to determine the nature of the plot twist.

3. **Anything else**  Otherwise the value of the dice are added together, and your skill points for the associated skill are added as well.  If you beat the challenge number you succeed.  Otherwise you fail.

## Invoking Genetics

Due to their alien ancestry, each player character has a **superpower** that sporadically manifests.  This can be anything the player, the other players and the GM agree on.  Some examples are [here](superpower.md).

If it is reasonable that a superpower would help with an action a D12 is rolled along with the six sided dice.  Or if the action is *only possible* due to the presence of the superpower, the D12 is rolled.  

1. If the player rolls their **genetic** number or below but above their **stress number** they:
    - Get a +3 to the action on top of their skill points is within the realms of capability for a normal Earthing.  Furthermore if a plot twist occurs, they are protected from an increase in the **hazard level** (more on hazard level [here](plot.md))

    - If the action was only possible due to their superpower there is no bonus - rather their power activates which explains why they are allowed to attempt this at all.

    - In either case, their **genetic number** increases by +1

2. If the player rolls above their genetic number, they fail if the action was dependent on their superpower (regardless of what the white dice say).  If the action was in the realm of acceptability for normal humans, but a superpower would have helped, then they simply don't get the +3 bonus.  

    - The player's **stress number** increases by one.

3. If the player rolls their **stress number or below** their stress number increases by +2.

Remember if your genetic number or stress number reaches **12** you get genetic sickness and get removed from the scene.  If your **stress number** equals or exceeds your genetic number you cannot do alien-dependent skill checks, or envoke your superpower.

It may seem that having a high **genetic number** is for the best . . . but this can hurt you during **interviews**. [More Here](interviews.md)
