#The World of the Martian Muckraker

 Many Earthlings long to see and reach for the stars again, but Earthâ€™s government grows more totalitarian each day.  Any discussion of aliens, or of Earth's former dealings with other planets is strictly forbidden.  

On Mars, a news outpost for the Milkyway Gazette constantly devises new ways to contact Martians and other multiterrestrials who are trapped behind the Great Barricade.  They call their publication **The Martian Muckraker**.

Against all odds, **Sarah Debattista** and the staff of the Martian Muckraker seek to defend press freedoms across the galaxy and to pass information to an offworld Martian ally named **C'therax** who aids them in their cause.

These are the Chronicles of the Martian Muckraker, the last honest newspaper in the Milky Way!
