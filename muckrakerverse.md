## Themes

1. **Truth and Justice** The world of Muckraker is a world where most people believe lies, and these lies help the rich and the mighty to oppress the outcasts, the poor, the different.  As someone who must hide their true identity, you seek to expose the corruption around you so that injustices can be rectified.

2. **Ethics and Choices** As muckrakers . . . you will be raking 'muck' and that muck impacts real people with real lives.  Lets say a player taps a memory to win an NPCs trust and that NPC reveals they commited a crime . . . but under severe duress.  Should the muckrakers keep the secret?  What if the NPC decides to do another crime, one where people could get hurt?  Every situation that is investigated should have more than one possible outcome, and that is not counting the "player's fail" outcome.

3. **Stories Inside of Stories** One possibility is to have the players not reveal their memories at the start of play.  Instead, have them reveal their memories as they are tapped.  That way the players see stories inside of a story; the past lives of the muckrakers is impacting the current plot, which will impact the lives of the NPCs the players meet.

4. **Wrongness**  In a muckraker story different people will have different beliefs about what is happening and why.  What does it mean to be right?  What does it mean to be wrong?  Are these absolutes?  What if you are right and don't want to be?  

5.  **Complexity of People** If a player taps a memory to get insight into an NPC, the kind of memory they tapped should influence the information they get.  A player that shares that they served hard time for not telling the truth may get a NPC to open up, but will also increase that NPCs fear.  A player that uses a memory of a time they were a leader to gain insight into an NPC may be able to get different info without getting that fear response.  This need not be good, bad or otherwise.  Just ways of coloring the story.  

6. **At what cost?** This is a game where players have to decide at what cost they are willing to get information.  Is it better to let someone work for a conspiracy if that conspiracy lets them feed their family?  Are the players willing to intimidate someone for information?  Is the deep cover the players have a form of lying and whom do these lies hurt?

> "John, when people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together."- Isaac Asimov
