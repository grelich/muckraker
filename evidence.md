To unravel the conspiracy you are trying to solve you will need to find **key evidence**.  

KUpon finding **key evidence** the GM will give you a **evidence card**, an index card that summerizes what you find.  Finding three such cards will allow you to **Solve the mystery**.  If you do this before you escale the [hazard](hazard.md), the players win.

Whenever **evidence** is found, the players have their **stress number** reduced by one, and can recover 1d6 **energy** to either their **mind**, **body**, or **spirit**.
